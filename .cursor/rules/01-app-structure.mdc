# Application Structure

The core application structure resides within the `src/app` directory, following Next.js App Router conventions.

- The main entry point and root layout is defined in `[layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.tsx)`. This file typically includes global styles, context providers, and the main HTML structure.
- The root page component is `[page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx)`.
- Subdirectories within `[src/app](mdc:src/app)` represent different routes (e.g., `[dashboard](mdc:src/app/dashboard)`, `[settings](mdc:src/app/settings)`).
- Global styles are defined in `[globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css)`.

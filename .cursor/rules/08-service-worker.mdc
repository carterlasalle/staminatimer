# Service Worker

The application uses a service worker, likely for caching or offline capabilities.

- **Registration:** The service worker is registered by the client component `[ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx](mdc:src/components/ServiceWorkerRegistrar.tsx)`. This component is included in the root layout `[layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.tsx)`.
- **Worker File:** The actual service worker implementation is located at `[sw.js](mdc:public/sw.js)`.
- **Environment:** Registration currently only occurs in the `production` environment.
